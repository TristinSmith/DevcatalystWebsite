<p>"I've been here a few times and the service is usually good, although not perfect you can tell the staff is trying.  The food is delicious and the margaritas are HUGE! It also has a fun environment." <strong>- Savannah Bishop</strong>

<p>"This restaurant had some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Everything was cooked to perfection. Too many Mexican restaurants overcook everything, but not this one. The rice was soft and well seasoned. The chicken was tender and with a rich flavor. The tacos were superb." <strong>- Jesse Cooper</strong>
